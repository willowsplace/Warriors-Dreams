# Warriors-Dreams
Windows 11 Ricing YASB Reborn theme
The name is a derivative of the 70s era movies involving warriors like Rambo, Missing in Action, etc. This is a recreation of 70s color schemes for [YASB Reborn.](https://github.com/amnweb/yasb.) 

I included the YAML and CSS files. Also, the wallpaper is from [Digital Blasphemy](https://digitalblasphemy.com/).
